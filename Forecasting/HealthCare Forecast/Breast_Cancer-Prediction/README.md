### Project Overview

This is an older project, completed in **June 2023**, that is now being uploaded to GitHub. The project focuses on developing a **cancer diagnosis prediction model** using a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier** with **3 neighbors**. The primary goal was to optimize the model to accurately identify cancer cases, with a strong emphasis on **reducing false negatives**, which represent undetected cancer cases. To achieve this, I prioritized improving **recall**, a metric that measures the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases.
